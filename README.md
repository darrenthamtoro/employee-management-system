# about
This project is about creating a program which allows the user/the owner of the business to keep track of their employees in a simple way. The program stores the employee's information such as what department they work in, what role they play in that department, and their bio such as their names, id, and a few other important informations. 

# about2
The program gives the users options at the start such as view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. All these options allow the user to keep track of their employees easily.

# View Department
The "View all Department" option displays a table which contains information such as the index, id, and name of the employees.

# View Roles
The "View all Roles" option displays a table which contains the index, id, title, salary, and department of the employees.

# View Employees
The "View all Employees" option displays a table which contains the index, id, first name, last name, role id, and manager id of the employees.

# Add Department
When the user selects the "Add Department" option, the program asks the user what department they would like to add. The user then types in the department name and it will be added to the list when the user selects "View all Department".

# Add Role
When the user selects the "Add Role" option, the program asks the user what department they would like to add. The user then types in the role name and it will be added to the list when the user selects "View all Roles".

# Add Employee
When the user selects the "Add Employee" option, the program asks the user the first and last name of the employee, the names will then be added to the list when the user selects "View all Employees".

# Update Employee Role
When the user selects the "Update Employee Role" option, the program askes the user which employee would like to switch role, the user will then be asked what role the employee would be. The new role that the employee has will be updated in the list when the user selects "View all Roles".

# Exit
When the user selects the "Exit" option, the program will display "Goodbye!!" and stop the program.
